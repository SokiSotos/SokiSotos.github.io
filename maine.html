            <p><b>Maine Coon cats are gentle natured and friendly, making them good companions. They are often tenderly playful and curious, making them kitten-like throughout their lives.</b></p>
                <br>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>The most recognizable characteristics of adult Maine Coon cats are their large size and long, bushy tail. Their paws are big and well-tufted to be suitable for walking in snow, as can be seen in both adult and kitten Maine Coon cats. In addition, their ears are tufted, often with points of hair at the tips.</p>
        <h2>Lifespan</h2>
            <p>10 to 13 years</p>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>The most common color for Maine Coon cats is brown tabby. However, they can be nearly any color and pattern. Their eye colors, too, have a wide range from blue to green to gold, and can include odd-eyes (i.e. two different colored eyes).</p>
        <h2>Shedding</h2>
            <p>The coat of a Maine Coon cat is shorter on the shoulders and longer on the stomach. It’s smooth, shaggy and sheds moderately, though not more than other breeds with plush coats. While they do require frequent grooming, Main Coon cats love attention so they typically don’t mind being brushed.</p>
        <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>Maine Coon cats are generally a hardy breed of cat. They’re built for enduring cold, harsh New England winters. Maine Coons can suffer from hip dysplasia, with the abnormality affecting the larger males more than females.</p>
            <p>Spinal muscular atrophy is a potential health problem that can result in muscle atrophy and weakness. This condition is normally seen early in the Maine Coon kitten’s life. This feline is also more prone to developing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than other breeds.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Many folktales surround the history of Maine Coon cats. Some involve Marie Antoinette, others surround an English seafarer named Captain Coon. One genetically impossible myth claims Maine Coons are the result of domestic cats mating with raccoons.</p>

            <p>It is believed Maine Coon cats are descendants of domestic short-haired cats that bred with Scandinavian cats brought to North America by Norsemen. As such, the Maine Coon cat may be related to the Norwegian Forest Cat.</p>
        <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p>In 1985, this all-American breed became the official state cat of Maine.</p>
