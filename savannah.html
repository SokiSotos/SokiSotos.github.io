                <br>
        <h2>Size</h2>
            <p>Large weighing 12 to 25 pounds </p>
        <h2>Coat</h2>
            <p>Short, slightly coarse </p>
        <h2>Color</h2>
            <p>Black, brown spotted tabby, black silver spotted tabby, black smoke </p>
                <br><br><br>
            <p><b>The Savannah Cat’s personality is playful, adventurous and loyal. Unlike most cats, she loves to play in water and can even be trained to walk on a leash and play fetch. Don’t be fooled by her dog-like personality, though.</b></p>
                <br>
        <h2>Temperament</h2>
            <p>Savannah Cats have strong hunting instincts, so they aren’t always suitable for households with pets like fish, hamsters, and birds. Her temperament is mild, though, so she’s a great companion to other cats and dogs, children and other humans in her home with proper socialization as a kitten.</p>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Although later generations of the breed are similar in weight to other breeds, they appear larger due to their height. Savannah Cats are characterized by their long, slender necks, triangular heads and large, wide ears that sit on top of their heads. They also have longer-than-average legs.</p>
        <h2>Lifespan</h2>
            <p>12 to 20 years</p>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>If you want an exotic-looking cat, the Savannah is a beautiful choice. Resembling their African Serval ancestors, Savannahs are typically black, brown or silver tabbies with black or dark brown spots. Some may have lighter colors or a smoked pattern, however.</p>
        <h2>Shedding</h2>
            <p>Savannah Cats are a lower-shedding breed, and so they require less grooming than long-haired breeds. Because of their playful nature, however, they may get into a mess and need a bath. Fortunately, they love water!</p>
        <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>Savannah Cats are a healthy breed, with no known genetic conditions or other health problems. They are at risk of suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening heart muscle) but are no more prone to heart problems than other cross-breeds. Responsible breeders screen for conditions that could negatively affect the breed.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Savannah Cat breed is a crossbreed of a domestic cat with an African Serval. The first kitten, named “Savannah”, was born on April 7, 1986 and the first generation possessed traits of both domestic cats and African Servals. They had the Serval’s size but the tameness of a domestic cat. In 2012, The International Cat Association (TICA) accepted the Savannah Cat as an official breed.</p>
        <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p>The Savannah Cat’s back legs are slightly longer than her front legs.</p>
