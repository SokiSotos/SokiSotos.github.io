        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Bengal Cats have an athletic appearance with well-defined muscles, creating a lean, balanced appearance. They feature high cheekbones, dark markings around the eyes and the ears are small and pointed but round at the tips. Their coats have a unique, plush feel unlike any other cat breed.</p>
        <h2>Lifespan</h2>
            <p>12 to 16 years</p>
        <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>One of the most distinctive features of this feline is its unique coat pattern and color. Most Bengal Cats’ coats have rich, highly contrasted shades of bright orange to light brown, with dark spots or a distinctive marbling pattern. Some even have a “glitter” to the tips of their fur, which glistens when the light hits it.</p>
        <h2>Shedding</h2>
            <p>A Bengal is fairly low maintenance. She won’t shed much and is an efficient self-groomer.</p>
        <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>Bengals may suffer from distal neuropathy and flat-chested kitten syndrome, both of which typically resolve on their own as the kitties mature. As they age, Bengals may develop other problems like hip dysplasia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, patellar luxation and progressive retinal atrophy.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Bengal Cat is a hybrid of a domestic cat with the wild Asian Leopard Cat. The first crossbreed was performed by Jean Mill in 1963, but the hybrid wasn’t perfected until the mid-1980s. Today, Bengals are bred only with each other.</p>
        <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p>The Bengal Cat’s name comes from the scientific name for the Asian Leopard Cat, Prionailurus bengalensis.</p>
